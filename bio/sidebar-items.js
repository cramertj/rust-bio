The implementations are based on the lecture notes \"Algorithmen auf Sequenzen\", Kopczynski, Marschall, Martin and Rahmann, 2008 - 2015.Algorithm of Horspool: fastest for a sufficiently large alphabet Shift And algorithm: fast for patterns with less than 64 symbols and very small alphabets. BNDM algorithm: fast for patterns with less than 64 symbols. BOM algorithm: fast for long patterns and small alphabet. KMP algorithm: the classical ancestor. Ukkonens algorithm: approximate pattern matching with dynamic programming. Myers algorithm: linear-time approximate pattern matching with edit distance for small patterns Another fast pattern matching algorithm is available in the twoway crate: https://crates.io/crates/twoway"],["scores",""],["stats","Mathematical and statistical tools."],["utils","Common utilities."]]});
