While creating CSV data is much easier than parsing it, having a writer can be convenient because it can handle quoting for you automatically. Moreover, this particular writer supports `Encodable` types, which makes it easy to write your custom types as CSV records.All CSV data produced by this writer, with default options, conforms with RFC 4180. (If certain options like flexible record lengths are enabled, then compliance with RFC 4180 cannot be guaranteed.)One slight deviation is that records with a single empty field are always encoded as `\"\"`. This ensures that the record is not skipped since some CSV parsers will ignore consecutive record terminators (like the one in this crate).ExampleHere's an example that encodes word pairs and their edit distances:"]]});
